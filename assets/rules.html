<h3>Rules of the SUPER TICTACTOE</h3>

<p>
The game works as a simple tictactoe but in every little cell there is an other tictactoe.<br>
In order to put your sign in one of the big cells you have to win its little tictactoe by putting your sign three times on the same row, column or diagonal.
The cell you play in, in the little tictactoe, determines the cell of the main board that your opponent will have to play in in the next turn.
For example, if you play in the central square of a little tictactoe, then your opponent will have to play in the central little tictactoe of the main board.
The colors will help you, you are allowed to play only in the red games!<br>
If the game you should play in is already over, you can play wherever you want.<br>
The first player to win three games such that the squares form a line wins the game!<br>
<strong>Good game and have fun!</strong>
